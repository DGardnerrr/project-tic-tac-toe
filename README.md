# project-tic-tac-toe
Rules:
1. one player is playing with "X", the other player is playing with "O"

2. If one player who owns X, gets three "X" in row, then that player wins

3. If the other player who owns O, gets three "O" in a row, then that player wins 

4. If both players are not able to get their "X" or "O" in a row, then they both lose


User stories:
1. As a player, I can play a game of tic tac toe with the other player

2. As a player, I should be able to reset game by clicking reset game

3. Switching turns between X and O for player A: 
In order to give the player 1 a challenge, player 2 will need to choose a move to play

4.  Switching turns between X and O for player B: 
In order to give the player 2 a challenge, player 1 will need to choose a move to play


5. As a player uncertain of the rules I want to be told who won and why so that I know whether I was successful in the game 


Main Takeaways From This Project:
1. Time Management, Organization, Consistent - being able to effectively make a plan on how your going to effectively work on the index.html, css, and javascript


2. Learning about the importance of concepts such as innerHTML, DOM selection, etc - these concepts play a major role in tic tac toe game - user interactions

1. Add more bonuses to my project 
- spending more time on my HTML - including a little more content to make game more interactive 

- being more creative with user face interactions with the tic tac toe game: including
