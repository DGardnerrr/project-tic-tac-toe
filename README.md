# project-tic-tac-toe
Description:
This is a game called Tic Tac Toe created with html, csss, javascript

Rules:
1. one player is playing with "X", the other player is playing with "O"

2. If one player who owns X, gets three "X" in row, then that player wins

3. If the other player who owns O, gets three "O" in a row, then that player wins 

4. If both players are not able to get their "X" or "O" in a row, then they both lose


Technical requirements:
Render a game board in the browser
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row, or show a draw if neither player wins
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation


Creating User Stories served a important role in helping with the game logic
User stories:
1. As a player, I can play a game of tic tac toe with the other player

2. As a player, I should be able to reset game by clicking reset game

3. Switching turns between X and O for player A: 
In order to give the player 1 a challenge, player 2 will need to choose a move to play

4.  Switching turns between X and O for player B: 
In order to give the player 2 a challenge, player 1 will need to choose a move to play


5. As a player uncertain of the rules I want to be told who won and why so that I know whether I was successful in the game 


Main Takeaways From This Project:
1. Time Management, Organization, Consistent - being able to effectively make a plan on how your going to effectively work on the index.html, css, and javascript


2. Learning about the importance of concepts such as innerHTML, DOM selection, etc - these concepts play a major role in tic tac toe game - user interactions

3. Being able to incorporate some of the concepts that were taught in the previous classes so far to this project


Additional steps I would have Took/Implementations:
1. Add more bonuses to my project 
- spending more time on my HTML - including a little more content to make game more interactive 

- being more creative with user face interactions with the tic tac toe game: including a score board, adding background music everytime a player clicks on each box, be more creative to substitute X and O with different characters that represent them


Some of Issues Encountered:
1. The use of DOM - not really familiar with DOM.However,was able to successfully master the concept after doing some practice, referring back to the previous lessons,recordings, labs
